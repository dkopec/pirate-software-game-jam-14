With a simple but satisfying mechanic, this game is perfect for all casual players.

## Concept

### Gameplay overview

The player controls their creep spreader, in order to place creepers and spread throughout the map.

Within the context of the game the only way to win is to spread your influence, the faster the better.

Following the idea of alien take over and the spreading of influence the game uses contrast between "natural" colors, a simple pallet of green, brown, purple and black allows for this.
